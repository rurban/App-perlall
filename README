Configuration in source-able shell script ~/.perlall

You might want to link perlall to a valid command with "-command" appended
  perlall-make perlall-do perlall-cpan perlall-maketest...

For the purposes I'm doing this for perlbrew is both overkill and really
wants to be installed in a more intrusive fashion than my primary use
case needs. This code does the specific things I need more simply and
therefore more reliably.
